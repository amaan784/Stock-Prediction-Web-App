Notes: 
    The graphs in the app are interactive (except the forecast components one)
    The default stock for prediction is AAPL (Apple) 
    The forecast part takes time to run since the computation by fbprophet is complicated

Forecasting is an estimation of a future events which one can make by incorporating and casting forward data related to the past in a pre-determined and systematic manner. Prediction is an estimate of future events made by subjective considerations.
