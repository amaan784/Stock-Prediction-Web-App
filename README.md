# Stock-Prediction-Web-App
A Stock Forecast / Prediction Web Application made using Streamlit

### Notes: 
- The graphs in the app are interactive (except the forecast components one).
- The default stock for prediction is AAPL (Apple).
- The default prediction year is 1.
- The forecast part takes time to run since the computation by fbprophet is complicated.
    
### TODO (maybe):
- download the csv file from the NASDAQ site (https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/screener)
- display all / most stock names in the selection or just allow a search. Use a pandas dataframe for it.

### Difference between Forecast and Prediction

Forecasting is an estimation of a future events which one can make by incorporating and casting forward data related to the past in a pre-determined and systematic manner. Prediction is an estimate of future events made by subjective considerations.
